/*
Write code for function get_dna_p_distance 

For two strings s1 and s2 of equal length, the p-distance between them 
is the proportion of corresponding symbols that differ between s1 and s2.

double p_distance = get_dna_p_distance("GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT", "CATCGTAATGACGGCCT");

distance will be 7 / 17= .4118
TIP: You'll need to round the answer to 4 decimals
